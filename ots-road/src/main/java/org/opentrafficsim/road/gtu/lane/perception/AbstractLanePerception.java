/**
 * The perception module of a GTU based on lanes. It is responsible for perceiving (sensing) the environment of the GTU, which
 * includes the locations of other GTUs. Perception is done at a certain time, and the perceived information might have a
 * limited validity. In that sense, Perception is stateful. Information can be requested as often as needed, but will only be
 * recalculated when asked explicitly. This abstract class provides the building blocks for lane-based perception. <br>
 * Perception for lane-based GTUs involves information about GTUs in front of the owner GTU on the same lane (the 'leader' GTU),
 * parallel vehicles (important if we want to change lanes), distance to other vehicles on parallel lanes, as well in front as
 * to the back (important if we want to change lanes), and information about obstacles, traffic lights, speed signs, and ending
 * lanes.
